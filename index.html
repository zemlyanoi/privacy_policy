    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>TodoPlanner</strong> Android application (“app”) published by the developer. By using the app, you agree to this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Data we collect and use</h2>
    <p>TodoPlanner is designed to keep your data on your device. We do not operate servers that collect or store your personal information.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tasks, categories, notes, and reminders</strong> – Stored only on your device in the app’s local database.</li>
        <li><strong>App preferences</strong> – Such as theme, language, and category order, stored on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Google account</strong> – If you choose to sign in with Google, we store your display name, email address, and profile photo URL locally on your device to show your account in the app. This data is not sent to our servers (we have none).</li>
        <li><strong>Optional calendar sync</strong> – If you enable calendar sync, the app reads your device’s calendar events (from any calendar on the device) and creates tasks from them. These tasks are stored only on your device. We do not transmit your calendar data to any third-party or our own servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internet</strong> – Used for Google Sign-In and for loading profile images when you sign in with Google.</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar (read)</strong> – Only if you enable “Calendar sync”; used to import calendar events as tasks on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone</strong> – Only if you use voice notes for tasks; audio is processed and stored on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications / alarms</strong> – To show reminders and schedule exact alarm times for your tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Boot completed</strong> – To reschedule reminders after the device restarts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services that may process data according to their own policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Sign-In (Google Play Services)</strong> – If you use “Sign in with Google,” your sign-in is handled by Google. Their privacy policy applies: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play</strong> – The app is distributed via Google Play; installation and updates are subject to Google Play’s terms and privacy practices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting SDKs that send your data to us or other third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Data storage and retention</h2>
    <p>All task data, preferences, and (if used) account information are stored locally on your device. If you uninstall the app or clear its data, this information is removed from the device. We do not retain copies of your data.</p>

    <h2>5. Children</h2>
    <p>TodoPlanner is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided data through the app, please contact us and we will address it.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised when changes are made. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the app’s data practices, please contact us through the support or contact option provided in the Google Play listing for TodoPlanner.</p>
